1. Start by measuring out 1 teaspoon each of ground sugar, ground espresso, and ground cocoa into a bowl or blender.
2. Add a splash of liquid water to the bowl or blender and mix to create a paste from the dry ingredients.
3. Next, add 1 cup of liquid milk to the blender and continue to mix until well combined.
4. Peel and chop one ripe banana and add it to the blender.
5. Add a handful of solid ice to the blender to make the drink cold and refreshing.
6. Blend all the ingredients together until smooth and creamy.
7. If the drink is too thick or the consistency is not to your liking, add more liquid water or milk to thin it out or make it creamier.
8. Once the drink has reached the desired consistency and texture, pour it into a glass and enjoy!
